# Primpl-Assembler
This assembler was done as an assignment question of CS 146, W23 offering, instructed by Brad Lushman, at the University of Waterloo. Relevant assignment is [Q8:Assembler](https://github.com/hg2006/Primpl-Assembler-W23-CS-146/issues/1#issue-1687729289)ã€‚
## PRIMPL: A primitive imperative language for teaching use
PRIMPL is a virtual machine language designed by the CS 146 instructor team at the University of Waterloo for teaching use, with PRIMPL stands for "primitive imperative language". The instructor also designed a corresponding assembly language for PRIMPL, namely A-PRIMPL. PRIMPL is an intermediate step in the course after the thorough discussion of C, and an instructor-designed imperative language: SIMPL (given that language is very simple). 
This project is about writing an assembler from A-PRIMPL to PRIMPL, completed as an assignment question of CS 146, W23 offering. No starter code has been given except for the [PRIMPL simulator](). Considering its difficulty, the instructor team has allowed this assignment to be completed in pairs.
